# Wellenplan GitHub Actions

These are the [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
that Wellenplan uses for CI/CD.

## Usage

See below for copy-pasteable examples of the provided actions.

If you need multiple actions to happen then it's up to you to combine them as needed. Please add an example if you use the same combo more than once.

üî• Until dependabot supports updating `jobs.call-workflow.uses`, we recommend using `@main` in all the examples below. This has been requested in [dependabot/dependabot-core@4327](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/4327). You know the drill, go üëç the issue to help us out. We'll switch back to using tagged releases once that is resolved.

### Directus Extension

Create the main `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` file for a Directus extension:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yaml
name: Directus Extension

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, synchronize, ready_for_review]

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: wellenplan/actions/.github/workflows/directus-extension.yaml@main
    secrets:
      ORGA_USER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ORGA_USER_TOKEN }}
      NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

### Semantic Release

For repos that have a seperate release process:


```yaml
# .github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml
name: Semantic Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  call-workflow:
    uses: wellenplan/actions/.github/workflows/semantic-release.yaml@main
    secrets:
      ORGA_USER_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.ORGA_USER_TOKEN }}
```
